                <h2>Hola!</h2>
                <p>I'm Michael Chang from Los Angeles, California.</p>
                <p>I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails at Dev Boot Camp in San Francisco. </p>
                <p>I'm also a digital marketer and yoga instructor.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p><span class="bold">A</span> driving force in my life is a desire to connect with others. Two of my biggest passions in life are travel and yoga, primarily because they enable me to cultivate a genuine connection with other human beings. As I dive into the world of development, I envision coding as an additional way towards this connection - not only via the final technical product, but also with many other simultaneously like-minded, yet nuanced individual programmers.</p>
                <p>Programming allows us to insert our voices and unique perspectives from our own slices of the world into re-shaping this world via technology. I see development as a way to transform how I see and interact with the world around me. As a means to continual growth and learning. As a path towards creative and technical potential.</p>
                <p>In this journey, I hope to merge my interests in travel, yoga, and social justice with my newfound passion for programming.</p>
