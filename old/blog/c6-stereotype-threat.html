                <h2>Stereotype Threat & Model Minority Myth</h2>
                <p>Reinforcing vs. Dismantling Stereotypes</p>
                <p>November 15, 2014</p>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikeychang2/mikeychang2.github.io/old/master/old/imgs/week-6-imgs/stereotype-threat.jpg">
                <p>I’ve grown up with the myth of the model minority looming over me, with every assignment I completed and every test I took. In fact, just the year before I was born, Times published as its cover story documenting <a href= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965326,00.html><span class="link">The New Whiz Kids</span></a>, which tells the tale of the exceptional academic excellence of Asian students, which itself is a broad term encapsulating the world’s largest and most populous continent, with the peoples of each country different and with the dynamics between each ethnicity largely unequal. However, this idea of the model minority dominated the academic climate in which I grew up and came of age.</p>
                <p>In some moments, it probably helped push me towards success. Perhaps, it’s a self-fulfilling legacy. Or perhaps, the article was right in that Confucian principles set Asian kids up to succeed in this test-driven, grade-obsessed academic world. However, in other times, it was overbearing and difficult. When you’re expected to be some sort of ‘model minority’ who excelled at math, and computers, statistics and science, you’re set up for failure, to disappoint, to fall severely short of expectations.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the stereotype threat — a term coined by Claude M. Steele — is a concept with which the social psychologist uses to explain minority under-achievement. It is the stereotype-based expectation of poor performance. He examines why certain African American students performed more poorly than white students when all metrics pointed towards equality. He explains this difference through how an individual feels about confirming as self-characteristics the negative stereotypes of his or her social group. It is the marriage of the impostor syndrome and negative stereotypes.</p>
                <p>When entering a new field or embarking on a new endeavor, most people already experience symptoms of the impostor syndrome. However, coupled with a climate where your intelligence, skills, or capabilities (not just in coding, but in athletics, or finance, or even in a social setting) is questioned on a regular basis by media, by colleagues, by everyday micro-aggressions, the effects are amplified. You begin to believe those ideas, at least on a subconscious level, are true. Granted, you can work hard to prove all the haters wrong, but as with all worthwhile challenges, we stumble, we fall, we encounter devastating failures. However, these failures, rather than becoming lessons with which we can grow and learn, become further evidence of our inferiority.</p>
                <p>It functions as a self-fulfilling prophecy that reinforces the anxiety of being deemed inferior.</p>
                <p>The model minority myth and the stereotype threat are two sides of the same coin. It is the reinforcement of stereotypes placed on certain social groups, perpetuated by media and encouraged by ignorance. It is the artificial paradigm that sets up certain groups to succeed and others to fail.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">My Experience With Stereotypes</span></p>
                <p>In coding, my stereotype actually predicts stellar performance - although in some ways, to my detriment. As an Asian and as a male, I actually fall into that stereotype that says I should be a whiz at this stuff - that I probably spent afternoons of my childhood, eyes glued to a screen, learning how to weave lines of code together. My reality couldn’t be further from the truth. While I was definitely a nerd in many different ways (I read a lot, I loved languages, and I sucked at sports), I was never quite the computer whiz these stereotypes perpetuate. With no programming experience, I’m starting from ground zero.</p>
                <p>I feel that people have this expectation that I naturally know what I’m doing. And after working with me on certain challenges or even having a conversation, I feel that I haven’t fulfilled their expectations. Basically, #impostersyndrome.</p>
                <p>However, as I made the leap to join DBC, the chorus of affirmations that I would excel at this “because I’m Asian" (at least, after the initial shock from those who know me well at me doing something “typical”) probably bolsters my confidence just a bit. At least, on a subconscious level. I can only imagine how my already-shaky confidence levels would fare after receiving negative feedback from others, questioning why I would be doing this and predicting my imminent failure - which essentially is what harmful negative stereotypes do.</p>
                <p>I’m Asian, but I’m both Korean and Taiwanese (which is different from Chinese), which are different from one another, each armed with their own intra-East Asian stereotypes. I’m gay. Some stereotypes I fulfill, but many, I don’t. I’m a yoga instructor and have a regular practice, but I also drink coffee and beer and sometimes, do things quite counter to the ideal “yogic lifestyle.” I’m an American, but when I’m abroad, I don’t look like one. I also don’t have the same conservative political leanings that those living in other countries believe all Americans espouse.</p>
                <p>I’ve encountered friends and acquaintances from very different backgrounds - race and ethnicity, gender and gender expression, sexuality, socio-economic background, class, political leanings and nationality. Basically, many, many hyphenated identities.</p>
                <p>And basically, what I’m trying to say is that I don’t live my live as a stereotype and neither do most people I know. We’re all an intersection of our social identities. Sometimes, we embody our stereotypes. Other times, we don’t.</p>
                <p>But when social stereotypes fall upon minority groups, they’re no longer allowed to be individuals. They get defined by it. Thus, when someone attempts to break out of their stereotypes and act to challenges those ideas (such as try coding), they have a tiny voice in the back of their head, prodding, questioning, challenging them. This voice lives inside all of us, but for those who deal with the stereotype threat, that voice bellows.</p>
                <p>Whoops, this ended up quite long. I tend to get into long-winded rants about these kinds of topics =P Can you tell I went to Berkeley? #</p>
