               <h2>Asking the Right Questions</h2>
                <p>Framing the Question to Get the Answer You Need</p>
                <p>December 3, 2014</p>
                <p>Asking questions is always vital in the learning process. When you don't know something, you can tap into other people's knowledge just simply by asking. There's something to be said for figuring something out on your own, but the beauty of the internet is that you can utilize existing resources to get the information you want.</p>
                <p>However, asking the right questions is necessary. Without framing the question the right way, you might get answers, but not necessarily answers that will help you.</p>

                <h2>Reflections on Building my Personal Site</h2>
                <p>Learning through Failing</p>
                <p>December 1, 2014</p>
                <p>Working on my personal website for DBC has been a challenging learning experience. Without any prior HTML/CSS experience, I was thrown into the first challenge on the second week of our Phase 0 period to create a page that would serve as our online entity - the jumpstart and virtual resume to our new careers as programmers. Immersion tends to be force you to fail quickly - and learn as a result. The first day working on my website took a lot time, more than expected. I went down a few rabbit holes, playing around with color scheme and fonts, spacing and sizing. I couldn’t quite get the positioning of objects. And some links and images didn’t turn out quite how I wanted them too.</p>

                <h2>Shame & Vulnerability</h2>
                <p>Dealing with Conflicts</p>
                <p>November 30, 2014</p>
                <p>As human beings, we are proned to experience shame, a type of conditioning we've cultivated since childhood. Shame is this paralyzing fear of what others might see - our true selves that we've deemed to be "less than." And it is this crippling fear that exposing our most authentic self might lead to rejection and criticism.</p>
                <p>We are hardwired for connection. And thus, this shame is a form of social control, a form of self control we impose on ourselves and each other in order to minimize the judgement and criticism that circulates around us - on television, in social media, in our daily lives. In fact, we try to cover up our inadequacies (from other but even from ourselves) so that we protect our egos from rejection and to foster connection with others.</p>
                <p>In talking about shame, it reminds of a book I read last year by Brene Brown, "The Power of Vulnerability."*** In this book, she talks about how vulnerability is the willingness to show up and let ourselves been fully seen. She discusses that often times, we are afraid to be vulnerable because it opens us up and forces us to tackle many of the sources of our shame...</p>

                <h2>Ruby Regular Expressions</h2>
                <p>Basic Pattern Matching, MatchData Objects & Lookarounds</p>
                <p>November 29, 2014</p>
                <p>Since beginning DBC 8 weeks (EIGHT. WEEKS. Has it gone by that fast?!), I've encountered the concept of regular expressions a few times. Every time, I tried to tackle the concept within the context of learning another new Ruby concept, it was difficult to comprehend. So, now that I have a foundational understanding of Ruby now, I decided that it was time to get at least a functional understanding of the concept before the on-site phase began.</p>
                <p>Regular expressions, or regexps, are patterns to match the contents of a string. They test whether a string has a given pattern. They also can extract portions of that match. Ruby regular expressions are Objects because everything in Ruby is an Object. This means that you can pass methods to these objects. It also means that you can set them to variables.</p>

                <h2>Ruby vs. JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Differences in Looping Methods</p>
                <p>November 21, 2014</p>
                <p>After spending several weeks getting accustomed to Ruby and its syntax, it was quite the challenge moving onto JavaScript. However, it is also because we spent the last couple of weeks, learning the foundation of Ruby (and programming concepts, such as Types, Booleans, and looping), that I felt a bit more comfortable understanding the less “user-friendly” syntax of JavaScript. One such concept that differs between the two languages, which would have been much more difficult to understand without basic Ruby knowledge, was looping.</p>
                <p>With Ruby, we have the handy #each method which allows us to iterate over collections, such as arrays and hashes. The iteration over each element produces lots of handy methods utilizing the #each method, such as #map or #reduce. The #each function makes it a lot easier for us to cycle through each element of a collection, rather than using the “for" or “while" loops.</p>

                <p>Battling Stereotype Threats</p>
                <p>November 21, 2014</p>
                <p>I actually just had a discussion with a friend on defining our core values - and using it as a way to determine whether the things in our lives (career, people, activities, lifestyle choices) align with what we value most in others and in ourselves.</p>
                <p>One value, contentment, has been absolutely important to me because it encompasses many other essential values that I believe leads to a fulfilled, wholesome, and complete life. Contentment seeks to instill inner peace, tranquility, harmony within our daily lives.</p>
                <p>It is the living in the moment.</p>

                <h2>Object-Oriented Programming: Classes vs. Modules</h2>
                <p>Key Differences & Purpose of Classes & Modules</p>
                <p>November 16, 2014</p>
                <p>Inheritance in Ruby allows you to do many nifty things with your code. It allows you to pass on code between different classes so that the subclass inherits methods, variables, and constants from its superclass, so that you don’t have to manually write the same lines of code for each object. However, Ruby doesn’t allow multiple inheritance. This means that your class will only have one superclass, rather than multiple parent classes.</p>
                <p>To bypass this single-parent dilemma, Ruby does allow you to implement multiple inheritance through modules. You can access the methods within certain modules as mix-ins. This opens up many possibilities; however, the key is to know when to use a class and when to use a module.</p>

                <p>November 15, 2014</p>
                <p>I’ve grown up with the myth of the model minority looming over me, with every assignment I completed and every test I took. In fact, just the year before I was born, Times published as its cover story documenting <a href= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965326,00.html><span class="link">The New Whiz Kids</span></a>, which tells the tale of the exceptional academic excellence of Asian, which itself is a broad term encapsulating the world’s largest and most populous continent, with the peoples of each country different and with the dynamics between each ethnicity largely unequal. However, this idea of the model minority dominated the academic climate that I grew up and came of age in.</p>

                <p>Pairing & Giving</p>
                <p>November 7, 2014</p>
                <p>Overall, throughout the past few weeks, the pairing component of Phase 0 has been beneficial. I tend to learn from working with other cohorts on the challenges, sharing information and resources the other might not have known - and compiling our fragmented understanding of coding and Ruby to figure out solutions to our problems. There have been many times where I was headed towards a different direction and simple comment or question from my partner allowed me to redirect my thinking towards more efficiently solving the challenge. Because we are all still Ruby newbies, constantly being bombarded with new concepts, syntax, and methods, it’s useful to have an extra set of eyes to review the code.</p>
                <p>Of course, when we’re getting into a steady flow and great work dynamic, the challenges are fun and rewarding. When I don’t know something, my partner happens to have a great suggestion. And when he or she doesn’t know something, then perhaps I have a sudden revelation...</p>

                <p>November 9, 2014</p>
                <p>Classes are first-class objects, each of which are instances of the class Class. Once created, you can set methods and attributes so that whenever a new instance of that class is created, it has contained within it a set of properties via instance variables and methods. Basically, you want to be able to create many objects with some common variables and accessible methods, but you don’t want to have to recreate these objects all individually.</p>
                <p>To create a class, you use the following syntax:</p>

                <h2>Diversity in Tech</h2>
                <p>Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities Hurts the Industry</p>
                <p>November 2, 2014</p>
                <p>When one thinks of a programmer or techie, a stereotyped image comes to mind. It is largely male. It is predominantly white. And it is increasingly Asian. These stereotypes are not far from the truth. Even a quick glance at the demographic breakdowns of the major tech companies reflect this obvious bias - where female, Black, and Hispanic populations are largely underrepresented in the ranks of the tech workforce. And even with Asian populations — itself a vast term that encompasses a huge population of the world’s largest continent — its representation among the general tech population may be over-represented; however, its inclusion in leadership drops significantly.</p>
                <p>And if coding is the new literacy, if it is the gateway to the future, where having this knowledge and where having a seat and say at the largest tech companies gives you a voice and a hand in shaping the direction of our society and world via technology, then having this underrepresentation of more than half of our society poses a huge problem...</p>

                <h2>Enumerable Methods: Group_by</h2>
                <p>Grouping Collections based on Criteria</p>
                <p>November 1, 2014</p>
                <p>Enumerable methods provide collections, such as arrays or hashes, with several ways to select, sort, or transform the elements of the collection. One less discussed, but particularly useful methods the Enumerable#group_by method, which when used on an array, iterates through the collection, passing each element to the code block, which contains the criteria by which the array will be grouped. The resulting output is a hash where the key represents each of the groups and the value is an array with all the elements of the input array that fit within that criteria. Essentially, the code runs through each element within the array; based on the requirements, Ruby places it within that group.</p>
                <p>Think of it like when you were in elementary school and the teacher has each of the students in the classroom count off from 1 through 5. All of the one’s were in one group, all the two’s in another, and so on. The criteria was which number you were. And each of the groups of students were the resulting arrays.</p>

                <h2>Reflections on DBC Phase 0</h2>
                <p>Abstract Thinking</p>
                <p>October 25, 2014</p>
                <p>My first week in Phase 0 was a whirlwind. The information was brand new. The workload was a lot more than expected. I was readjusting to studying for long periods of time again, being four years out of college. And I was readjusting from a long trip abroad. Plus, it didn't help that I was a few days, having just returned from that trip. I was definitely feeling frustration, self-doubt, and a ton of stress.</p>
                <p>However, fast forward 3 weeks and I feel much more comfortable and confident in my progress. While the workload is still a lot more than initially expected, and while we're still getting bombarded with a lot information, synapses are firing up, the knowledge is finally settling in a bit, and "aha" moments are much, much more frequent. I've gotten into my own little flow of things.</p>
                <p>I've definitely moved along faster than I would have learning by myself. The curriculum allows me to focus on specific concepts needed for the week, rather than going down a rabbithole, typical of my personal self-study experience. I'd get lost on a particular problem, eventually get derailed by this issue, and lose motivation to continue studying for the evening.</p>

                <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes in Ruby</h2>
                <p>Differences & Similarities</p>
                <p>October 24, 2014</p>
                <p>In Ruby, we store values for later use by assigning them to variables. Like num1 = 52. Or counter = 3.</p>
                <p>Arrays and hashes are simply another, better way to organize this data.</p>
                <p>Both are indexed collections that store objects. The key difference is how you access them. You access both through a key - the key for arrays being an integer associated with the array's numerical index, while the key for hashes being another object.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Arrays</span></p>
                <p>Arrays are simply a list of things. They can be strings, integers, floats - really, any object. We store them within square brackets, where every list item is a variable. Basically, arrays are objects that contain ordered lists of other objects.</p>

                <p>Breaking Down CSS Positions</p>
                <p>October 19, 2014</p>
                <p>"There are 4 different types of CSS positioning properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Static</li>
                    <li>Absolute</li>
                    <li>Relative</li>
                    <li>Fixed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are also 4 different positioning rules: top, bottom, left or right.</p>
                <p>It might be helpful, first, to envision every single element on the page as a block. Rectangular pixels. Positioning then is useful in moving your object - itself, a block of pixels - to exactly where you want it to go.</p>
