                <h2>Shame & Vulnerability</h2>
                <p>Dealing with Conflicts</p>
                <p>November 30, 2014</p>
                <p>As human beings, we are proned to experience shame, a type of conditioning we've cultivated since childhood. Shame is this paralyzing fear of what others might see - our true selves that we've deemed to be "less than." And it is this crippling fear that exposing our most authentic self might lead to rejection and criticism.</p>
                <p>We are hardwired for connection. And thus, this shame is a form of social control, a form of self control we impose on ourselves and each other in order to minimize the judgement and criticism that circulates around us - on television, in social media, in our daily lives. In fact, we try to cover up our inadequacies (from other but even from ourselves) so that we protect our egos from rejection and to foster connection with others.</p>
                <p>In talking about shame, it reminds of a book I read last year by Brene Brown, "The Power of Vulnerability."*** In this book, she talks about how vulnerability is the willingness to show up and let ourselves been fully seen. She discusses that often times, we are afraid to be vulnerable because it opens us up and forces us to tackle many of the sources of our shame. These "shame triggers", as she calls them, are the root cause of our shame - and all the accompanying symptoms of anger, dissatisfaction, and hopelessness. These triggers of shame differ with each individual. For some, the lack of conventional success is a source of shame. For many women and increasingly men, body image produces much shame, reinforced by constant judgement - by ourselves and the media. Whatever the sources of our shame, any reminder of this deficit induces a reaction.</p>
                <p>Shame triggers some part of us that tells us we are not enough. It chips away at our self-worth. It ties our internal value to something external. And as a result, in our conflict with ourselves and others, we often react in a particular way because that conflict exposes this shame.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Compass of Shame</span></p>
                <p>Those with shame resilience are able to cope with these conflicts in an emotionally healthy way. They know that these deficits in their lives are not tied to their value to the world. They draw their attention away from the conflict to memories of being accepted and loved. However, those unable to process an exposure of their shame tend to react in one of a few ways.</p>
                <p>As illuminated by the Compass of Shame, people tend to react the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Withdrawal (isolating oneself, running/hiding)</li>
                    <li>Attacking Others (turning tables, victim blaming, lashing out verbally/phsyically)</li>
                    <li>Attacking Self (puts oneself down)</li>
                    <li>Avoidance (denial, abusing drugs/alcohol, distraction through thrill-seeking)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="bold">Personal Experience with Conflict</span></p>
                <p>About a year ago, I got into a conflict with one of my best friends. We were supposed to get together that day. We hadn't hung out in a while and I was excited to explore LA with her. That morning, I received a quick text from her asking if I minded that she bring the guy she was seeing along with us, since she was already with him.</p>
                <p>Initially, I really didn't mind. After all, I'm pretty easygoing - at least, I'd like to think so. However, she kept postponing when we were going to meet up because they were still at breakfast. Then, he had to pick up his car. It went from my excitement for an all-day adventure with my friend to a waiting game for hours to feel like a third wheel.</p>
                <p>During that time, I began to attack myself and my self-worth. Later on, after a tense meetup with my friend and her date, I decided to meet up with another friend for some drinks to distract from my frustration. Which as I learned just now is called avoidance.</p>
                <p>I realized that my feelings stemmed my personal shame in cultivating and maintaining friendships, tracing its origins from childhood. As a kid, I struggled with making friends. And even though, since high school and college, I've been surrounded by lots of awesome people and meeting and making friends hasn't been a problem at all anymore, this remains a source of shame. I notice that I constantly question whether people actually value my friendship.</p>
                <p>For those few hours, my experience led to a downward sprial, inducing other shame triggers - my single status, my body image, my self-worth as a friend/partner.</p>
                <p>We eventually had a talk and everything ended up just fine. It was a really silly argument, but reflecting on this experience helps me to understand the sources of certain conflicts I have. Also, it reminds me that someone else's actions don't necessarily mirror the intent you personally believe is behind their actions. Rather than the negative self-talk tied to my self-worth, I could have saved myself a few hours of negativity.</p>
                <p>***Brene Brown did an awesome TEDTalk on Shame & Vulnerability - you can watch it <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame?language=en">here</a>!</p>
