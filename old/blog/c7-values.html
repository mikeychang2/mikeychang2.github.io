                <h2>Values & Affirmations</h2>
                <p>Battling Stereotype Threats</p>
                <p>November 21, 2014</p>
                <p>I actually just had a discussion with a friend on defining our core values - and using it as a way to determine whether the things in our lives (career, people, activities, lifestyle choices) align with what we value most in others and in ourselves.</p>
                <p>One value, contentment, has been absolutely important to me because it encompasses many other essential values that I believe leads to a fulfilled, wholesome, and complete life. Contentment seeks to instill inner peace, tranquility, harmony within our daily lives.</p>
                <p>It is the living in the moment.</p>
                <p>It is understanding that our joy and happiness are not predicated on external circumstances. Rather, they depend on our internal landscape. That happiness and joy can be a state of mind, an attitude, a way of interacting with the external world outside of our control. We might not be able to control everything that happens in the world, but we have possibilities and powers in many situations.</p>
                <p>Contentment is knowing that everything is impermanent. That everything is temporary. Both the horrible moments that make us question our existence, and also, the hope-, passion-, purpose-filled moments that dispel all doubts that we are exactly where we are meant to be.</p>
                <p>Contentment is enduring these tough moments, knowing they don’t define us, knowing that this, too, shall pass. And it is expressing gratitude for those perfect moments, big and small, that make life worth living for.</p>
                <p>But, contentment is also not complacency. Rather, it’s finding the line between being okay with where you are now, rather than where you’re “supposed to be.” It is not comparing yourself against others in weighing your self-worth, but rather reflecting on yourself as a form of calibration to improve and grow. Because we’re all capable of improvement, but we’re all awesome right now too.</p>
                <p>It’s mostly just a great reminder that many qualities that you currently embody, that many things that you have — they were all once things you probably desired, dreamt of in the past. If you postpone your joy for “once I get a job/raise” or “once I get married” or “once I lose 50lbs,” you likely will never experience joy. You’re so accustomed to postponing your personal satisfaction that it becomes a habit. Once you get that raise, marriage, or weight loss, you’ll find the next thing to covet.</p>
                <p><span class = "bold">My Top 5 Values:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adventure</li>
                    <li>Close Relationships</li>
                    <li>Freedom</li>
                    <li>Inspiration & Growth</li>
                    <li>Inner Peace & Contentment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Out of a scale of 1 - 5, I rate the statement "I try to live up to these values" with a 4. I might not always be perfect in embodying these values, but I do keep them at the back of my mind in whether I’m surrounding myself with people and partaking in activities that foster these values in my life. However, there's always room for improvement! :)</p>
                <p>Last topic I gave advice on was probably on self-worth tied to employment, status, and appearance.</p>
                <p><span class = "bold">Values & Stereotype Threat</span></p>
                <p>Personally, sticking to this idea of contentment has worked well for me, when I begin to feel stress about the direction of my life, about whether I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, when I realize that peers are thriving in “successful” fields already, while I’ve been wandering around the last couple of years. I focus on the things that are going well in my life, that most of these things (close relationships, adventure, health, growth) are all things I should be grateful for.</p>
                <p>Whenever I think about these values, I feel good. I feel that as long as I’m striving towards these ideals — that I am doing my daily best (not necessarily, the best) to embody these values, I am progressing. It helps me to think about whether I’m working towards my goals and values, towards being the person I want to be. It also helps to write down all the things that I’m grateful for in my life. It redirects my mind from thinking about the negative to thinking about all the positive in my life.</p>
                <p>Other exercises: meditation, yoga, taking a walk, reconnecting with my breath/present moment, talk it out with others, working out, actually taking a hike, spending time with loved ones.</p>
