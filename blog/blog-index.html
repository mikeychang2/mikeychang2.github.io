                <h2>Diversity in Tech</h2>
                <p>Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities Hurts the Industry</p>
                <p>November 2, 2014</p>
                <p>When one thinks of a programmer or techie, a stereotyped image comes to mind. It is largely male. It is predominantly white. And it is increasingly Asian. These stereotypes are not far from the truth. Even a quick glance at the demographic breakdowns of the major tech companies reflect this obvious bias - where female, Black, and Hispanic populations are largely underrepresented in the ranks of the tech workforce. And even with Asian populations — itself a vast term that encompasses a huge population of the world’s largest continent — its representation among the general tech population may be over-represented; however, its inclusion in leadership drops significantly.</p>
                <p>And if coding is the new literacy, if it is the gateway to the future, where having this knowledge and where having a seat and say at the largest tech companies gives you a voice and a hand in shaping the direction of our society and world via technology, then having this underrepresentation of more than half of our society poses a huge problem...</p>

                <h2>Enumerable Methods: Group_by</h2>
                <p>Grouping Collections based on Criteria</p>
                <p>November 1, 2014</p>
                <p>Enumerable methods provide collections, such as arrays or hashes, with several ways to select, sort, or transform the elements of the collection. One less discussed, but particularly useful methods the Enumerable#group_by method, which when used on an array, iterates through the collection, passing each element to the code block, which contains the criteria by which the array will be grouped. The resulting output is a hash where the key represents each of the groups and the value is an array with all the elements of the input array that fit within that criteria. Essentially, the code runs through each element within the array; based on the requirements, Ruby places it within that group.</p>
                <p>Think of it like when you were in elementary school and the teacher has each of the students in the classroom count off from 1 through 5. All of the one’s were in one group, all the two’s in another, and so on. The criteria was which number you were. And each of the groups of students were the resulting arrays.</p>

                <h2>Reflections on DBC Phase 0</h2>
                <p>Abstract Thinking</p>
                <p>October 25, 2014</p>
                <p>My first week in Phase 0 was a whirlwind. The information was brand new. The workload was a lot more than expected. I was readjusting to studying for long periods of time again, being four years out of college. And I was readjusting from a long trip abroad. Plus, it didn't help that I was a few days, having just returned from that trip. I was definitely feeling frustration, self-doubt, and a ton of stress.</p>
                <p>However, fast forward 3 weeks and I feel much more comfortable and confident in my progress. While the workload is still a lot more than initially expected, and while we're still getting bombarded with a lot information, synapses are firing up, the knowledge is finally settling in a bit, and "aha" moments are much, much more frequent. I've gotten into my own little flow of things.</p>
                <p>I've definitely moved along faster than I would have learning by myself. The curriculum allows me to focus on specific concepts needed for the week, rather than going down a rabbithole, typical of my personal self-study experience. I'd get lost on a particular problem, eventually get derailed by this issue, and lose motivation to continue studying for the evening.</p>

                <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes in Ruby</h2>
                <p>Differences & Similarities</p>
                <p>October 24, 2014</p>
                <p>In Ruby, we store values for later use by assigning them to variables. Like num1 = 52. Or counter = 3.</p>
                <p>Arrays and hashes are simply another, better way to organize this data.</p>
                <p>Both are indexed collections that store objects. The key difference is how you access them. You access both through a key - the key for arrays being an integer associated with the array's numerical index, while the key for hashes being another object.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Arrays</span></p>
                <p>Arrays are simply a list of things. They can be strings, integers, floats - really, any object. We store them within square brackets, where every list item is a variable. Basically, arrays are objects that contain ordered lists of other objects.</p>

                <h2>What are the Differences between Static, Absolute, Relative, and Fixed Positioning</h2>
                <p>Breaking Down CSS Positions</p>
                <p>October 19, 2014</p>
                <p>"There are 4 different types of CSS positioning properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Static</li>
                    <li>Absolute</li>
                    <li>Relative</li>
                    <li>Fixed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are also 4 different positioning rules: top, bottom, left or right.</p>
                <p>It might be helpful, first, to envision every single element on the page as a block. Rectangular pixels. Positioning then is useful in moving your object - itself, a block of pixels - to exactly where you want it to go.</p>
