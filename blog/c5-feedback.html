                <h2>Thoughts on Pairing & Feedback</h2>
                <p>Pairing & Giving</p>
                <p>November 7, 2014</p>
                <p>Overall, throughout the past few weeks, the pairing component of Phase 0 has been beneficial. I tend to learn from working with other cohorts on the challenges, sharing information and resources the other might not have known - and compiling our fragmented understanding of coding and Ruby to figure out solutions to our problems. There have been many times where I was headed towards a different direction and simple comment or question from my partner allowed me to redirect my thinking towards more efficiently solving the challenge. Because we are all still Ruby newbies, constantly being bombarded with new concepts, syntax, and methods, it’s useful to have an extra set of eyes to review the code.</p>
                <p>Of course, when we’re getting into a steady flow and great work dynamic, the challenges are fun and rewarding. When I don’t know something, my partner happens to have a great suggestion. And when he or she doesn’t know something, then perhaps I have a sudden revelation. Along the way, we’re teaching each other new concepts and tricks - as well as reinforcing good testing habits. On the other hand, frustration and difficulties arise when both partners are stumped on a particular solution. I can recall feeling completely lost - and noticing the same energy from my partner — when neither of us had any new suggestions anymore. Browsing the internet or the Ruby docs wasn’t helping. Scanning the code for any syntax errors wasn’t working.We were just stuck. I’ve learnt from this experience to step away from the challenge and regroup, perhaps even spending some time looking at it by yourself after taking a mental break.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Feedback</span></p>
                <p>Reading through the feedback is helpful in affirming what aspects of my pairing was beneficial to other students. It also helps to see what areas I could use help in. However, I do feel that the feedback received tends to fall on the side of “kind” versus “actionable.” After reviewing my feedback, I plan on being a little bit more assertive and vocal when it comes to pairing. Initially, when Phase 0 began, I felt all symptoms of the impostor syndrome, where I saw other students as having more experience and background in this field. As a result, I felt insecure in expressing any ideas I might have had during the pairing sessions. Student feedback said that I probably knew more than I thought and that I could be more vocal even as a driver. I feel a bit more comfortable with the material. And I realize that everyone has something to contribute to each others’ learning process, so even if it might not be the “correct answer,” my suggestion could potentially inspire my partner to think a different way, leading us to figure out the challenge.</p>
                <p>Writing feedback has been a bit more difficult. It’s hard to put into words what worked and what didn’t work specifically with a partner. Sometimes, it was just a difference in working style and personalities. However, overall, providing feedback for others has been an exercise in reflection. In thinking about what worked, what didn’t work, and why. Not just for the partner, but also for myself. As I think about areas of improvement for my partner, I reflect about whether I also could improve in that area.</p>
                <p>Pairing has been a great learning tool for me. I’ve learned a lot from my cohort and it pushes me to time-box a lot more, since I’m on someone else’s time. Moreover, pooling our shared understanding and resources is an efficient way to learn and progress. However, to be honest, sometimes having to provide feedback seems a bit of a chore; however, I realize it is important to the process. Not only is it a way to push each other to improve ourselves and our communication skills, it is a way to motivate us through little snippets of encouragement on what we are doing right.</p>
