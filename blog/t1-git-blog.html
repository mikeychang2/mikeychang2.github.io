                <p>Choose Your Own Adventures: Introduction to Git, GitHub, and Version Control</p>
                <p>October 11, 2014</p>
                <p>Verizon control is like the interactive children's book series, "Choose Your Own Adventure." You read the book to a certain checkpoint. You are then faced with a few different options, each of which leads to more options, then to one of many endings. If at any point, you decide that you don't like the progress of your chosen storyline, you can revert back to any of the previous stopping points and choose an alternative plot. In the end, you've created a linear story - to your satisfaction.</p>

                <p>Similarly, version control allows coders to utilize the idea of "branches" to play around and "choose their own adventure." If you decide that the code for a particular branch is progressing the program in a desired manner, you can integrate it to the master, and then continue onwards. Just like in the book series. And if you decide none of the alternate branches are working, you simply go back to a previous stopping point, and choose another option.</p>

                <p>Using git, a version control software, you rely on commits, or "saves" to create these checkpoints. This ensure that you avoid losing work, wasting hours, days, or even months simply because you accidentally deleted portions of your program. If at any point, your code breaks, you simply go back to the previous commit and boom! youâ€™re back to hacking away.</p>

                <p>Another benefit of version control is that it allows for easy collaboration among team members, whether just two developers or a team large enough to fill a gymnasium. This tool allows coders to work simultaneously on the program, using different branches. The commits can then be reviewed before being integrated back into the master. This streamlines the process, saving time and ensuring quality control.</p>

                <p>To maximize the benefits of git, you have Github - an online hub, a sort of social network connecting developers. You upload your code onto GitHub for other developers to review and to contribute. It stores all commmits in an organized manner so that you can jump back and forth through time as you wish. Here are some of the reasons to use Github:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Protects your work because it resides remotely on the internet</li>
                    <li>Serves as a portal for team members to collaborate on the same code</li>
                    <li>Eliminates the need for back-and-forth emails or flashdrives</li>
                    <li>Allows others to follow the process and thinking behind the code beacuse they can see all the commits and changes</li>
                    <li>Provides developers a platform to share their code and to receive feedback</li>
                    <li>Contributes to an open-source community</li>

                <p>Just as in the book series, with version control, you have the ability to progress forward without fear of consequence. Git gives you the power of time travel -  back to a previous commit and restart your program.</p>
