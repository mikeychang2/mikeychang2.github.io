                <h2>Asking the Right Questions</h2>
                <p>Framing the Question to Get the Answer You Need</p>
                <p>December 3, 2014</p>
                <p>Asking questions is always vital in the learning process. When you don't know something, you can tap into other people's knowledge just simply by asking. There's something to be said for figuring something out on your own, but the beauty of the internet is that you can utilize existing resources to get the information you want.</p>
                <p>However, asking the right questions is necessary. Without framing the question the right way, you might get answers, but not necessarily answers that will help you.</p>
                <p>My natural inclination has always been to figure things out on my own; however, in the last couple years, I've worked towards asking questions and requesting help when I need clarification. I've found that it's actually saved me lots of time and grief - and that most people are actually eager to help! Even in my personal life, I've progressed from trying to figure out directions myself to asking passerbyers for help.</p>
                <p>Asking for help with directions doesn't really require framing the question in any particular way. However, with programming, there are some best practices towards minimizing stress for those Good Samaratins and maximizing your knowledge and the assistance received. When asking questions (whether in person, on the Google+ community, or on StackOverflow), it's important to keep the following in mind.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Imagine that you are trying to answer the question yourself.</span></p>
                <p>You've spend quite some time reviewing the code, trying to figure out the problem. You understand the context of the problem very well. However, someone who is looking at the issue the first time won't understand that context. It's important that you frame the question with all relevant information.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Ensure that the question is easy to read and understand.</span></p>
                <p>This requires that you not only provide relevant information, but to review the question. Proofread to ensure the question is clear, concise, and grammatically correct.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Question title needs to encapsulate the issue.</span></p>
                <p>Make sure that the title specific. General questions like "Why does't this work?" or "Please help!" will likely attract minimal attention and you'll probably get few responses. The title doesn't necesarily need to be a question, but it does need to capture the general theme of the issue at hand. Having a clear, concise title is important because people are browsing through so much information, they shouldn't have to parse through the entire thread just to figure out what your question actually is.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Make sure you provide context.</span></p>
                <p>Provide the language and platform you're referring to. Also, be sure to include any constraints. It's also important to describe what you've already tried; make sure you've done due diligence. Providing sample code can be very helpful, but probably not the entire program - just enough to isolate the problem! Lastly, the larger goal/aim should be clear. Others might have insight or suggestions on how to accomplish that broader goal through a different direction.</p>
