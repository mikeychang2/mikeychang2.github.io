                <h2>Diversity in Tech</h2>
                <p>Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities Hurts the Industry</p>
                <p>November 2, 2014</p>

                <p>When one thinks of a programmer or techie, a stereotyped image comes to mind. It is largely male. It is predominantly white. And it is increasingly Asian. These stereotypes are not far from the truth. Even a quick glance at the demographic breakdowns of the major tech companies reflect this obvious bias - where female, Black, and Hispanic populations are largely underrepresented in the ranks of the tech workforce. And even with Asian populations — itself a vast term that encompasses a huge population of the world’s largest continent — its representation among the general tech population may be over-represented; however, its inclusion in leadership drops significantly.</p>
                <p>And if coding is the new literacy, if it is the gateway to the future, where having this knowledge and where having a seat and say at the largest tech companies gives you a voice and a hand in shaping the direction of our society and world via technology, then having this underrepresentation of more than half of our society poses a huge problem. Programming gives people the ability to contribute their ideas and their values in finding solutions to the problems of our world. But when the problems that are being solved are largely white (and increasingly Asian) upper middle-class, male issues, then that itself becomes a problem. When those disenfranchised lack a voice in tech, where arguably is the direction our world is headed, we are doing ourselves and the world a great disservice.</p>
                <p>While it is important to recruit across all intersections of the population, the push towards diversity within the tech workforce begins even before recruiting — in the classroom. It begins at a young age, when children are cultivating their interests. It starts when little girls and boys are begging for Christmas gifts. Boys are often encouraged to tinker with computers, whereas girls are not. It begins with encouraging STEM education among these underrepresented minorities. It begins with funneling resources and revamping education in school districts with a dearth of resources for even basic math and reading.</p>
                <p>It begins with changing the consumer culture in our society, where the average person is not encouraged to understand tech, but to merely consume it.</p>
                <p>And it begins with changing societal perceptions of what it means to be in tech. As an Asian male, I do, in fact, fit into society’s image of a programmer. However, as of this present moment, that couldn’t be further from the truth. I come from a nontechnical background. I find myself struggling even in the initial weeks of Dev Boot Camp. And I definitely don’t feel like I fit that image. But as a male — as an Asian male — I will perhaps get more benefit of the doubt from peers and others because I fit that mold. In fact, even as I share my career change with friends, their first reaction is how different and in fact, random it was that I was making this industry shift. However, their reactions are almost immediately followed by “But you're Asian. You’ll be good at it.”</p>
                <p>What we need to do is change that perception, to shift the image of tech from “brogrammer” culture to one that is more inclusive, to understand the underlying bias among all of us, so that underrepresented minorities don’t need to struggle twice as hard to prove their worth and knowledge.</p>
