                <h2>Reflections on DBC Phase 0</h2>
                <p>Abstract Thinking</p>
                <p>October 25, 2014</p>
                <p>My first week in Phase 0 was a whirlwind. The information was brand new. The workload was a lot more than expected. I was readjusting to studying for long periods of time again, being four years out of college. And I was readjusting from a long trip abroad. Plus, it didn't help that I was a few days, having just returned from that trip. I was definitely feeling frustration, self-doubt, and a ton of stress.</p>
                <p>However, fast forward 3 weeks and I feel much more comfortable and confident in my progress. While the workload is still a lot more than initially expected, and while we're still getting bombarded with a lot information, synapses are firing up, the knowledge is finally settling in a bit, and "aha" moments are much, much more frequent. I've gotten into my own little flow of things.</p>
                <p>I've definitely moved along faster than I would have learning by myself. The curriculum allows me to focus on specific concepts needed for the week, rather than going down a rabbithole, typical of my personal self-study experience. I'd get lost on a particular problem, eventually get derailed by this issue, and lose motivation to continue studying for the evening.</p>
                <p>Plus, knowing the intensity of the on-site program and the drive of fellow cohorts inspired (really, lit a fire under my ass) to study hard now to ensure I don't fall behind. The support of other students really helps when I'm learning concepts and also when I'm feeling a bit lost with the entire experience.</p>
                <p>My biggest struggle, thus far, has been the steep learning curve with jumping right into learning code without any previous technical background. Another struggle is that I tend to compare where I currently am in my stage of learning to where I think I should be or where I perceive others to be - which hurts more than helps me. It discourages me and minimizes progress that I have already made. I might not be as knowledgeable (yet) as some others out there, but I'm definitely more knowledgeable than I was last week, or even yesterday.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Learning Styles</span></p>
                <p>Before we began Phase 0, we were asked to take a quick quiz to figure out our primary (and secondary) thinking and learning styles.</p>
                <p>The Gregorc Thinking Styles places people into one (or more) of four categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Concrete Sequential</li>
                    <li>Abstract Sequential</li>
                    <li>Concrete Random</li>
                    <li>Abstract Random</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My primary learning style tends towards Abstract Sequential (AS), which operates in the world of theory and abstract thought. Those with an AS inclincation move towards thinking in concepts and analyzing information. We enjoy reading. We enjoy thorough research. We focus on key points and significant details. We're logical, rational, and intellectual. And there is a tendency towards working alone vs. working in team environments.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, my secondary learning style is Abstract Random (AR). Those with an AR thinking style organize information through reflection and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. They operate in the world of feelings and emotions. Our minds absorbs information and impressions - and we organize these thoughts through reflection. We learn by association. We are influenced heavily by emotion.</p>
                <p>While I think these two learning styles already encompass a pretty broad learning spectrum, I feel that the Concrete thinking styles lend themselves more towards a typical developer's mindset (the Concrete Sequential learner processes information in ordered, linear ways, whereas the Concrete Random learner loves experimentation and trial-and-error approaches). I know that I enjoy the analytical inclinations of an AS and the people-oriented environments of the AR. These have always been my comfort zones while in traditional eductional environments.</p>
                <p>However, with a growth mindset, where learning is the means and the end, where every instance is an opportunity for learning, growth, and development, I am hoping to cultivate some of the learning capabilities of the Concrete thinking styles, particularly the experimental nature of the CR and the CS orientation towards formulas and rules.</p>
                <p>As I continue learning Ruby in the next few weeks, I will push myself towards testing the code out myself as I am reading through books and articles - so that I'm experimenting and seeing it in action for myself. I also plan to be more systematic with understanding and remembering different methods we are learning, perhaps creating cheat sheets of key concepts and methods we have learned thus far.</p>
