        <h3>Combating My Imposter Syndrome</3>
        <h4>October 12, 2014</h4>
        <p>"You are exactly where you are supposed to be. Each and every day, each and every time you make it onto the mat, you're building the strength, you're building the muscles necessary to one day, get into that pose."</p>

        <p>I repeat this mantra to my students after they attempt an arm balance.As a yoga instructor, I remind my students not to compare themselves with other students, that their bodies are unique and different. I remind them that as long as they are progressing, they are where they're supposed to be, that minor advances will one day yield the results they desire, that the journey is the destination.</p>

        <p>After even just my initial week at DBC, I find myself struggling to digest the same words I repeat in each yoga class I teach. Because I come from a non-technical background, the learning curve has been quite steep for me. Even just navigating within the terminal or setting a git remote has been challenging. I find myself battling the "imposter sydrome" - that voice inside my head that tells me I'm in over my head with this coding thing.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to lie. The culture at DBC scares me. But it also inspires me. The kitchen mentality, which encourages students to take charge, to shape their own learning experience, to grow in a fully immersive, collaborative environment, appeals to me. Although I've always thrived in a traditional educational environment, I love the idea of learning quickly in a team setting, fully immersed with the subject at hand and surrounded by highly-motivated, driven individuals.</p>

        <p>I'm excited for this journey, and I'm definitely nervous. As I watched Shereef's fireside chat, I felt my hands get a little sweaty as I anticipated the actual on-site phase. It was a feeling of slight discomfort. I thought, perhaps, my decision to go through with DBC was a mistake. But I think that being uncomfortable is good, that growth and learning happens outside of our comfort zones. It is in this place of tension where we expand our minds, and maybe learn something new.</p>

        <p>I knew that DBC was going to be a difficult experience, but regardless, I signed up for it. With the kitchen mindset, I have a hand in shaping my own DBC experience...so, I'm going to learn to code; I'm going to transform the way I see and interact with the world; and I'm going to make some life-long friends while doing it.</p>
