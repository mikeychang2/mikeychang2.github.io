      <p><h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
      <span>Technique where one individual (driver) writes the code and the other (navigator) directs and reviews the code.</span></p>

    <br>

    <p><h2>Why is pair programming important?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To learn from each other</li>
        <li>To have two sets of eyes while writing code</li>
        <li>Driver can focus on completing current task and navigator can focus on being strategic</li>
        <li>Each can act as an inspirational springboard for the other - reviewing code, helping to clarify concepts, etc.</li>
        <li>To learn to how to work/cooperate well with others</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h2>Driver vs. Navigator?</h2>
      <h3>Driver</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Actually implements</li>
        <li>Focuses on the syntax</li>
        <li>Complete current task</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Nagivator</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How to implement</li>
        <li>Focuses on the line that is being written</li>
        <li>Be strategic</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Pairing was great because it allowed us to share information, to let go of control, to think creatively, and to collaborate on a project. Some information that I didn't know off the top of my head, my partner did - and vice versa. This allowed us to work through building this website more quickly, without having to stop and research certain concepts. Plus, explaining concepts also helps us reinforce understanding. Because we're all pretty new to HTML/CSS, minor syntax errors were present, which was harder to fix with a partner since having to discuss such small changes took up a lot of time. However, as we get more comfortable with the languages, our time can be better focused on format, layout, and strategy.</p>
